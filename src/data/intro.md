Welcome to our website!

We combine mathematical and statistical modeling techniques to leverage biologic, clinical and population data with the goal to inform and guide clinical decision making and public policy.

Our cross-disciplinary team works at the interface of molecular biology, clinical research and population health sciences, all tied together by mathematical multi-scale modeling approaches.
