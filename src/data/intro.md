Welcome to the website of our research collective. We combine mathematical and statistical modeling techniques to leverage biologic, clinical and population level data with the goal to inform and guide cancer early detection and prevention. Our growing team is very cross-disciplinary and our work is situated at the interface of molecular biology, clinical research and population health sciences, all tied together by mathematical multi-scale modeling approaches.
